## The Fear of the Runaway Loop

The biggest challenge in autonomous infrastructure isn't intelligence—it's **Control**. If an agent identifies a gap and attempts a mutation that introduces a new gap, you risk a "Recursion Storm" where the machine burns your cloud budget in a circular attempt to fix itself.

In an **Agentic Ready** environment, we solve this through three non-negotiable safety layers: **Recursion Guards**, **Approval Gates**, and **VPC Isolation**.

## The Recursion Guard

Every mutation event is tracked by a global limiter. The Recursion Guard monitors the depth and frequency of mutations per resource. If the engine attempts to mutate the same resource more than a predefined number of times in a short window, the guard pulses a `HALT_AND_REFLECT` event, locking the resource until a human intervenes.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": ["rds:DeleteDBInstance", "s3:DeleteBucket"],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": { "Bool": { "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false" } }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Context Isolation

Safety also means limiting what the agent can "see". By using strict VPC boundaries and IAM roles, we ensure the agent only has access to the resources you have explicitly whitelisted. This **Context Isolation** prevents the agent from accidentally wandering into production databases or sensitive configuration stores.

> Safety isn't about stopping the agent; it's about giving it the freedom to move within a secure fortress.
