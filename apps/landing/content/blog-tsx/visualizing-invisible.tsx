    <p>
      When we talk about technical debt, we usually talk about lists. A linter
      report with 450 warnings. A backlog with 32 "refactoring" tickets. A
      SonarQube dashboard showing 15% duplication.
    </p>

    <p>
      But for AI-generated code, lists are deceiving. "15 duplicates" sounds
      manageable—until you realize they are all slight variations of your core
      authentication logic spread across five different micro-frontends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Text-based metrics fail to convey <strong>structural complexity</strong>.
      They tell you <em>what</em> is wrong, but not <em>where</em> it fits in
      the bigger picture. In the age of "vibe coding," where code is generated
      faster than it can be read, we need a new way to understand our systems.
      We need to see the shape of our debt.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution: Introducing the AIReady Visualizer</h2>

    <p>
      To tackle this, we've built the <strong>AIReady Visualizer</strong>. It's
      not just another static dependency chart; it’s an interactive,
      force-directed graph that maps file dependencies and semantic
      relationships in real-time.
    </p>

    <p>
      By analyzing <code>import</code> statements and semantic similarity (using
      vector embeddings), we render your codebase as a living organism. When you
      see your code as a graph, the "invisible" structural problems of AI code
      debt suddenly become obvious visual patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>The Shape of Debt: 3 Visual Patterns</h2>

    <p>
      When we run the visualizer on "vibe-coded" projects, three distinct
      patterns emerge—each signaling a different kind of risk.
    </p>

    <h3>1. The Hairball (Tightly Coupled Modules)</h3>

    <img
      src="/hairball-pattern.jpg"
      alt="The Hairball Pattern - A dense cluster of interconnected nodes"
      className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-md my-4"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>What it looks like:</strong> A dense, tangled mess of nodes where
      everything imports everything else. There are no clear layers or
      boundaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Problem:</strong> This pattern kills AI context windows. When
      an AI agent tries to modify one file in a "Hairball," it often needs to
      understand the entire tangle to avoid breaking things. Pulling one file
      into context pulls the whole graph, leading to token limit exhaustion or
      hallucinated dependencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> You need to refactor by breaking cycles and
      enforcing strict module boundaries. The visualizer helps identify the
      "knot" that holds the hairball together.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The Orphans (Islands of Dead Code)</h3>

    <img
      src="/orphans-pattern.jpg"
      alt="The Orphans Pattern - Disconnected clusters of nodes"
      className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-md my-4"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>What it looks like:</strong> Small clusters or individual nodes
      floating completely separate from the main application graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Problem:</strong> These are often fossils of abandoned AI
      experiments—features that were generated, tested, and forgotten, but never
      deleted. They bloat the repo size and confuse developers ("What is this{' '}
      <code>legacy-auth-v2</code> folder doing?"). More dangerously, they can be
      "hallucinated" back to life if an AI agent mistakenly imports them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> If it's not connected to the entry point, delete
      it. The visualizer makes finding these islands trivial.
    </p>

    <h3>3. The Butterflies (High Fan-In/Fan-Out)</h3>

    <img
      src="/butterflies-pattern.jpg"
      alt="The Butterflies Pattern - A central node with many connections"
      className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-md my-4"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>What it looks like:</strong> A single node with massive
      connections radiating out (high fan-out) or pointing in (high fan-in).
      Often seen in files named <code>utils/index.ts</code> or{' '}
      <code>types/common.ts</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The Problem:</strong> These files are bottlenecks and context
      bloat.
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>High Fan-In:</strong> Changing this file breaks{' '}
        <em>everything</em>. AI agents struggle to predict the blast radius of
        changes here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High Fan-Out:</strong> Importing this file brings in a massive
        tree of unnecessary dependencies, polluting the AI's context window with
        irrelevant code.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>The Fix:</strong> Split these "god objects" into smaller, deeper
      modules.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <p>Under the hood, the AIReady Visualizer combines two powerful tools:</p>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>@aiready/graph:</strong> Our analysis engine that parses
        TypeScript/JavaScript ASTs to build a precise dependency graph. It
        creates a weighted network of files based on import strength and
        semantic similarity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>D3.js:</strong> We use D3's force simulation to render this
        network. Files that are tightly coupled naturally pull together, while
        unrelated modules drift apart, physically revealing the architecture (or
        lack thereof).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Use Case: Bridging the "Vibe" Gap</h2>

    <p>We're seeing a growing divide in engineering teams:</p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>The "Vibe Coders":</strong> Junior devs or founders using AI to
        ship features at breakneck speed. Their focus is <em>output</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Engineering Managers:</strong> Seniors trying to maintain
        stability and scalability. Their focus is <em>structure</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The visualizer bridges this gap. It's hard to explain abstract
      architectural principles to a junior dev who just wants to "ship it." It's
      much easier to show them a giant, tangled "Hairball" and say,{' '}
      <em>
        "See this knot? This is why your build takes 15 minutes and why the AI
        keeps getting confused."
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Visuals turn abstract "best practices" into concrete, observable reality.
    </p>

    <h2>See Your Own Codebase</h2>

    <p>
      Don't let your codebase become a black box. You can visualize your own
      project's shape today.
    </p>

    <p>
      The visualizer ships as part of the unified <code>@aiready/cli</code>.
      Three commands gets you a full interactive graph:
    </p>

    <div className="my-6">
      <CodeBlock lang="bash">{`# 1. Scan your codebase
npx aiready analyze

# 2. Start the interactive visualizer
npx aiready visualise

# 3. Export a shareable static report
npx aiready visualise --output report.html`}</CodeBlock>
    </div>

    <div className="my-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
      <img
        src="/example-visualisation.png"
        alt="Example AIReady visualisation"
        className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-md"
      />
      <p className="text-center text-sm text-slate-500 mt-3 italic">
        Example visualiser output highlighting clusters and token-cost overlays.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>The output gives you:</p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Colour-coded nodes</strong> by AI readiness score (green → red)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Edge thickness</strong> proportional to import coupling strength
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cluster labels</strong> automatically identifying Hairballs,
        Orphans, and Butterflies
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hover tooltips</strong> showing token cost, import depth, and
        cohesion score per file
      </li>
      <li>
        A <strong>shareable HTML report</strong> you can open anywhere — no
        tooling required
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What&apos;s Next</h2>

    <p>
      This wraps up the six-part &ldquo;AI Code Debt Tsunami&rdquo; series. If
      you&apos;ve followed along, you now have:

        <strong>Why</strong> AI code debt forms faster than traditional debt
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Why</strong> your codebase is invisible to AI — semantic
        duplicates, fragmentation, low cohesion
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What</strong> metrics actually capture AI-readiness
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How</strong> to detect semantic duplicates automatically

    <p>
      The natural next step is moving from <em>detection</em> to{' '}

      (currently in beta) is designed to do: auto-generated refactoring plans,
      trend tracking over time, and team-level benchmarks.
